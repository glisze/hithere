	release/v0.0-rc1: Following the release proceedings
	Note: this is still under deveopment.

	Issues:

	1. The version number. Its inputs include: .version, configure.ac (bootstrap), git describe (maybe), ...?
	2. The sha256: this determines this package, for now in ./guix.scm to allow 'guix build -f guix.scm'

	The process is noted within ./doc/release

	release/v0.0-1-g566ff2e0: NEWS updated

	release/v0.0-2: or so, developing release policies

2018-07-25  Gunter Liszewski (s70-10)  <gunter.liszewski@gmail.com>

	release/in process: making the git tag, as required

	release/v0.0-$( git describe ): this is required for the automake 'gnits' thing, that prescribes the NEWS to relate to the version number, as well as the git checkout to be tagged in a compliant way.
	* NEWS: updated to show the release version

	release/v0.0, make distcheck: guix.scm is missing
	touch guix.scm: this file will be generated from guix.scm.in with
	its proper sha256, and version identifiers.

	Admin, ChangeLog: ./scripts/gitlog-to-changelog

	Merge branch 'develop'

	hithere, guix.scm.in, upload: distribution procedures

2018-07-25  Gunter Liszewski (s70-10)  <gunter.liszewski@gmail.com>

	hithere v0.0.7: With an 'official' tar line, and the 'guix.scm' is with sha256
	'guix build -f guix.scm' builds it into the store
	'guix package -f guix.scm' installs this
	'hithere' runs it

	This uses scripts that exercise the procedures to make a package for the
	guix system. The scripts make the hash, of the distcheck target, and
	upload to a trial location. Several issues are seen; this is still
	a pseudo release, v0.0.7.


	* guix.scm: the local package definition

2018-07-25  Gunter Liszewski (s70-10)  <gunter.liszewski@gmail.com>

	hithere v0.0: the first release with its developing administrative policy
	This is still in the process of finding a proper alignment with agreed and accepted compliance to a release and
	development process.

	'guix build -f guix.scm' is the command that should build this, here.

	Processes will change, and 'guix package -i hithere', with a stable
	release, and development policy is the aim, for tis here


	* NEWS: more on this topic of developing policies
