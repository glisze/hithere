	hithere, guix.scm.in, upload: distribution procedures

2018-07-25  Gunter Liszewski (s70-10)  <gunter.liszewski@gmail.com>

	hithere v0.0.7: With an 'official' tar line, and the 'guix.scm' is with sha256
	'guix build -f guix.scm' builds it into the store
	'guix package -f guix.scm' installs this
	'hithere' runs it

	This uses scripts that exercise the procedures to make a package for the
	guix system. The scripts make the hash, of the distcheck target, and
	upload to a trial location. Several issues are seen; this is still
	a pseudo release, v0.0.7.

	hithere v0.0: the first release with its developing administrative policy
	This is still in the process of finding a proper alignment with agreed and accepted compliance to a release and
	development process.

	'guix build -f guix.scm' is the command that should build this, here.

	Processes will change, and 'guix package -i hithere', with a stable
	release, and development policy is the aim, for tis here
