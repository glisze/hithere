An example editing session.

1. Read the 'scripts/rights-left.in' text into register '0'.

[9 hx9 hk erscripts/rights-left.in y hx0 hk g9 ]9

2. To be sure, to be sure: look at the content of text register '0'

:g0


3. Now put the apropriate values into their places.



To be continued. For now there is a dump of the text registers:

x0 has:

x1 has:

fs<year>2018fs<name of author>Gunter Liszewski



x2 has:

[9 hx9 hk g0 m1 hx8 hk g9 ]9

And we have used the text register 9 to keep a stack the buffer stages with 

[9 hx9

and here they are. On top of the stack is the most recent previous state
of the text editing buffer:

top of x9, :g9


On second thoughts, and after doing the :x9 thing, this just repeats what you
see above; well, partially.




So do this

]9 :g9


4. After a few pop-offs, here is one early state of things, done with something
like ]9 ]9 ]9 :g9

An example editing session.

1. Read the 'scripts/rights-left.in' text into register '0'.

2. To be sure, to be sure: look at the content of text register '0'

:g0


3. Now put the apropriate values into their places.
