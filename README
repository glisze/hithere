Hi there,

This exercises the method that GNU advertises to be the good new automation of
the software program build.

info automake, info autoconf, info make, info gcc
all give lots of info. Information, that is to be noted

Today is Friday, 2023-05-05.  We are exploring ways to make this run on
our Mac mini M2, the AArch64, or arm64 architecture of the Apple Silicon.

This is still experimental. We aim to explore the feasabilities of things.
