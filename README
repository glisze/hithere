* GNU Guix Channels
  Announcements about the packages on this channel should be made in
  [[etc/news.scm.in]]. The shell function 'set-commit' can assist in editing
  the commit hash.  This will allow our news to appear after a 'guix pull.'

** About the Git Repository
  We start with two Git repositories.  First on this list is a clone of
  the official GNU Guix repository.  The second repository on this list has
  *our* package definitions and configuration files.
#+begin_src text
  guix-0-here
  channel-0-here
#+end_src
  We have two Git branches that deal with channel authentication.  They
  hold the public keys for the commit signatures.
#+begin_src text
  guix-0-here/keyring
  channel-0-here/keyring-here
#+end_src

** Channels
   Here it is.  The file '~/.config/guix/channels.scm' tells GNU Guix
   where to find things like package definitions.

   Below is the template that can be filled out by the 'set-commit' shell
   function.
