* GNU Guix Channels
  Announcements about the packages on this channel should be made in
  [[etc/news.scm.in]]. The shell function 'set-commit' can assist in editing
  the commit hash.  This will allow our news to appear after a 'guix pull'

** About the Git Repository
  We start with two Git branches.  First on this list is the official
  GNU guix distribution channel.  The second branch on this list has
  our package definitions and configuration files.
#+begin_src text
  acquire-guix-master
  channel-0-here
#+end_src
  We have to Git branches that deal with channel authentications.  They
  have public keys that have been used to sign commits
#+begin_src text
  keyring
  keyring-here
#+end_src
  We have renamed the following five branches to make it clear that they
  are no longer 'active.'  However, as they are experiments they now serve
  as notes.  They should eventually disappear, once lessons have been
  digested.
#+begin_src text
  z-acquire-xen-0-guix-master
  z-main
  z-main-subtree-experiment
  z-next-subtree-here-push-to-next
  z-xen-0-guix-master
#+end_src


** These channels
   Here it is.  The file '~/.config/guix/channels.scm' tells the GNU Guix
   application where to find its package defnition and its program code.

   Again, the shell function 'set-commit' may be used to substituted the
   actual commit.
