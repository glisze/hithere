* Configuring the linux kernel
  The [[i/t53.config.x501u][Linux onfiguration]] has been reduced to some essential items. It runs, here,
both as ~Dom0~ and as ~DomU~ within the ~Xen~ environment.

  A [[_/_/20191124222019-xl-create-c-to_xen-0.cfg][log file of the start]] of a paravirtualised machine creation (~xl create -c to_xen/0.cfg~)
shows some promise towards these efforts, here.

  - Note that this is unfinished work.
