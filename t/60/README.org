* xen-0-hurd
  We want to run a GNU Hurd system with GNU Guix under a Xen setting.  This builds on
previous exercises.   The GNU Guix xen-0-boot, and xen-0-tools packages have been build.

** The package definition 'xen-0-hurd'
   We start with the given GNU Guix package: (gnu packages hurd).  From it we extract only
the gnumach kernel public definition into xen-0-hurd.scm.  We will add '--enable-platform=xen'
and add the '(gnu packages hurd)' as an imported module.
