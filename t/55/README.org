* xen-0-libs wants to be build
  This is after copying these products into the development branch, and
from there into the repository, of a local kind, that is pointed at by this
machine's channel file. Then, after rebasing local changes, such as xen-0-tools
(but also other changes; notably eudev; to work with this machine's btrfs)
the ~xen-0-tools~ refuse their builder. This is here, now.
