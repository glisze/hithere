v0.0.6-rc0

2018.07.23 16:10 Monday.

This has passed the test of 'make dist' within a separate build directory.
The aim is now, again, to exercise the release process, and then test the
guix (build|package|environemt|) -l guix.scm --with-source=hithere=./
installation/build procedures. RFC: does this work.

First the development and release policy.
Make on feature in its own feature branch. In this case the branch is named
'feature/0002/guix-things'. The branch name reifies the notions of: branch
type, locally unique serial number, descriptive identifier. RFC: is that
reasonably pragmatic. For example 'git checkout $( git branch | grep 0002 )'
is one example command line that benefits from the uniqueness of the branch
name's embedded serial number. This unique feature appears to me to be
reasonable visible and memorable within working memory's life cycle.

Of course, 'hithere' does nothing but say its greeting. The essence is the
administrative-, development-, and operating system surrounding of it.

v0.0.5

This is the brand new thing, for today. It now uses git-version-gen.
Is this any good?
